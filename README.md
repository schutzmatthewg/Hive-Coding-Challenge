# D&D: 5e Character Sheet

As my first time using angular, I decided to make something that my friends and I have been wanting for years, a good replacement for the paper character sheet system for Dungeons and Dragons.  This character sheet is meant to hold data for a new character with the 5e ruleset of D&D.  It utilizes a firebase database to allow a user to log in and create a new character sheet and visit ones they have made in the past.

## Getting Started

This project can be run using npm start or ng serve as an angular command.

```
