# D&D: 5e Character Sheet

As my first time using angular, I decided to make something that my friends and I have been wanting for years, a good replacement for the paper character sheet system for Dungeons and Dragons.  This character sheet is meant to hold data for a new character with the 5e ruleset of D&D.  It utilizes a firebase database to allow a user to log in and create a new character sheet and visit ones they have made in the past.

### Prerequisites

This is an angular project so you will need npm and Node.js.
If you don't have them, you can install them by visiting https://nodejs.org/en/ .

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
